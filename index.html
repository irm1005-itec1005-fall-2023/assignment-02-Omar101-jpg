    <h3>Lures</h3>
    <p> Lures can be used in many ways, there are floating lures and sinking lures and so much more. Depending on what fish you are trying to catch the lure will vary. For example, if you were going catfish, you would need a sinking lure.
    </p>
 
    <h4> How To Feel A Bite</h4>
    <p> To learn how to feel a bite is unexplainable, the best way to know, is by actually going out there and fishing. One of the best ways to learn it, is by using a live worm and a simple jig, throw it out and learn to feel bites.</p>
    
    <h4> Baits </h4>
    <p> Depending on what you want to catch, there is a huge selection of baits, fish will eat anything. Best kind of baits are livebaits but some say otherwise, livebait can work on a bass and so can a spoonbait.</p>
  </p>
  <h4> Knots</h4>
  <p> There are many knots a person can do and learn when setting up their lures or jigs. The most easiest type of knot that is very useful, is the fishermans knot, but if you are trying to go for something even stronger, then the polymier knot is for you.</p>
       
    
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
 
    <p> A lot of new fishermen always have questions, so lets answer some.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Why Am I Always Snagged?</li>
    <li> Why Does My Lure/Jig Get Ripped Off?</li>
    <li> Whenever I Hook A Fish, All My Line Is Pulled</li>
  </ul>
    <h2> Answers</h2>

    <p> Firstly, why are you getting snagged? One of the most common reasons, is a person will let their bait sit for so long that it sinks and they drag it against the bottom. The best way to avoid getting snagged, is yes let your lure sink, but point your rod up so its off the bottom while reeling.</p>
    
 <p> Why does your lure keep getting ripped off? Most of the time its because when you do your knots, you must check if they are strong before casting, that way if you made any mistakes doing your knot, you dont lose ur lure/jig, always test your knots!!!!</p>
 
 <p> Why is all your line pulled when hooking a fish? The main reason why this happens is because they forgot that they have to set their drag on their rod, that way the fish cannot keep pulling line.</p>
